# Boat_Runner
This is a project for Computer Graphics course, which is a game in which a boat keeps going forward (third-person view) and obstacles (rocks) appear in
its path. The player must avoid the obstacles by using the keyboard to move the boat. The project has been done in HTML-5, using Web-GL 2.0.
The code has the following sections: it explicitly loads the geometries and the textures, sets the shaders (which must be written by yourself), sets the vertex formats and the uniforms, and where drawcall
are used to finally show the scene on screen. The project is in object space.
